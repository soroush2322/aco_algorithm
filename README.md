## Ant Colony Optimization üöÄ
<div align="justify">
<p>
The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is one of the well-known and practical metaheuristic algorithms. In metaheuristic terminology, an algorithm is considered to be one that uses a specific pattern of utilizing random events to optimize a value. In other words, these algorithms are often an attempt to model an optimization process in the real world.

Around 1991, Dr. Marco Dorigo became an interesting phenomenon by studying the behavior of ant colonies when finding food. At first, they wander aimlessly in the surrounding environment to find the main food, until they reach a single and optimal path from the nest to the food source and move in tandem on the same path, this special behavior of ants is due to the presence of a special substance called has it. It was a pheromone that they left behind when moving, later Dr. Dorigo modeled this behavior in mathematical language.

## About This Implementation üñ•Ô∏è
<div align="justify">
<p>
ACO is a suitable solution for finding the shortest path in discrete problems, one of the problems that is solved well and with a high percentage of confidence by this algorithm is the TSP problem, There are 8 cities in random coordinates, the goal of solving the TSP problem is to find the shortest Hamiltonian path among these cities, ACO has different types that are used for different applications and each one has specific parameters, this implementation almost the simplest type of this algorithm, I have written an explanation in the original code as a comment to help you better understand the algorithm.
